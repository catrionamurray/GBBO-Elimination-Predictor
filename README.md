# GBBO-Elimination-Predictor
A fun project exploring the Great British Bake Off (GBBO) results across Seasons 3-16! ðŸŽ‚ The goal was to predict when a contestant will be eliminated based on their past weekly performance, using data from 14 seasons of GBBO (sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sarahvitvitskiy/great-british-bake-off-results-seasons-1-14) and Wikipedia).

Logistic regression model trained on Seasons 3-9 and tested on Seasons 10-14:
